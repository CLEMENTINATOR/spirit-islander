# Spirit Islander

### Live site: [https://www.spiritislander.com](https://www.spiritislander.com)

This is a setup generator for the board game [Spirit Island](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/162886/spirit-island) by R. Eric Reuss. Spirit Island is highly modular, so there are many different ways a player can configure the setup at the outset of a game that add interesting variety and challenge. This tool, Spirit Islander, removes the burden of having to calculate these game setups manually by instantaneously generating a game setup at random that adheres to the player's prefences.

Spirit Islander is built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

#### Future Ideas

1. Save the user's preferences is their browser's local storage so that the form field choices will persist on a page refresh
1. Enable shift + click usage to select/deselect a range of checkboxes at once
1. A "Play" feature accessible from the Game Setup screen that has a victory/defeat calculator so that the user can tally their final game score

#### Goals of this project:

- Build an app with a significant amount of user interaction
- Improve Svelte skills further by building a complex form
- Make a useful yet simple tool that works well on desktop and mobile

#### Local installation:

To run this locally on your machine, clone the repo and enter the following commands into your CLI:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
